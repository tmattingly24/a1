            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone. My name is Tim Mattingly. I am 34 years old and I currently live in southern Indiana with my wife and three children who you can enjoy seeing in the pictures above. Crystal my wife, Madison my daughter who is 15, Hiraim my middle son who is 11, and Timmy my youngest who will be 4 in March. I, of course would be the goofy looking guy in the pictures who everyone is wondering how he managed to be a part of such a beautiful family :) We live a rather simple life here in Indiana, we all very much enjoy the outdoors (when it is warm that is) and try very hard to be a close knit traditional family. As for me I have an engineering background and coding has been a passion of mine for quite some time, mostly as a hobby although I have dabbled in it a little professionally in engineering roles. When the skills exist employers enjoy using them right? This is not a complaint, it is a great thing. This makes my 12th class here at the extension school and I am really enjoying my time here. I have a passion for learning and the extension school does a wonderful job of helping me pursue that passion. I look forward to working with you all throughout the semester! </p>
